# Price Stability

We are using many mechanisms to control the price and reduce pumps, dumps, and continuous price decline that has happened to some blockchain games.

### Mining Limits

Compound Interest is the #1 issue of blockchain games. In the beginning, players with little investment, reinvest their income into the game which is good for the game's economy. But after a while, they will reach to an enormous huge income which grows faster than community growth, and when they start cashing out, the token price will continuously decline.

In order to prevent this issue, we generate limited lands to mine per day. If all available lands get sold out, Players have to place bids for the next land so players have to pay more tokens to own a land to begin mining. This will increase demand for the token and decrease the supply of the token.&#x20;
