# Price Stability

We are using many mechanisms to control the price and reduce pump, dumbs, and continuously price declining that experience in some other blockchain games.

### Mining Limits

Compound Interest is the #1 issue of blockchain games. In the beginning, players with little reinvest their income into the game which is good for the game's economy. But after a while, they will reach  enormous huge income which is faster than community growth, and when they start cashing out, token price continuously declines.

To overcome this issue we generate limited lands to mine per day. If available lands sold out, Players have to place bids for the next land so players have to pay more tokens to own a land to mine. This will increase demand for token and reduce the supply for the token.
