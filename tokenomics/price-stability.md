# Price Stability

We are using many mechanisms to control the price and reduce pumps, dumps, and continuous price decline that has happened to some blockchain games. 

### Aggressive Token Burn
70% of all tokens that players spend in-game will burn, the rest 30% will move back to the reward pool. The last token will be mined in the 2034 year or later. After that, we may use the reserved token pool to continue the game's economy.

### Mining Limits

Compound Interest is the #1 issue of blockchain games. In the beginning, players with little investment, reinvest their income into the game which is good for the game's economy. But after a while, they will reach an enormous huge income that grows faster than community growth, and when they start cashing out, the token price will continuously decline.

To prevent this issue and control token supply in the market, we generate limited lands to mine per day. So there are limited tokens to mine every day like most blockchain coins. If all available lands get sold out, Players have to place bids for the next land so players have to pay more tokens to own land to begin mining. This will increase demand for the token and decrease the supply of the token.

### Mining Cycles
At the beggining of the game, 5000 lands (common, uncommon, rare, and legendary) will become  available to buy everyday. These lands have 1,300,000 tokens in total to mine. After every cycle, tokens of new Lands will be reduced by 5%. Token mining also reduce 5% after every cycle. First cycle length is at least 10 days, second cycle is 11 days, and every cycle is one day longer than previous cycle. Cycle duration may become longer if all of the lands not sold out.

### Conclusion
Chian of legends's deflationary systems, Limits token mining and supply, burn tokens aggressively and reduced mining rewards overtime. In the result game's token will become more and more rare and valuable. As NFTs are priced by game's token they will become more valuable overtime even more valuable than token. for example a Legendary legendary land in early days of the game has ~3000 tokens but a legendary land in next 100 days have ~2000 tokens. So buying and holding game's token is very profitable, and game's NFTs are even more profitable. Thanks to deflationary system.
