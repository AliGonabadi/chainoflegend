# 🏕 Guilds

There are [treasure Islands](battles.md#treasure-island) with different difficulties to occupy. Some of them are to occupy on your own and of course, there are more treasures. You can join a guild or create your own guild and play with your friend to occupy Island and defend it from other players' invasion.

Every guild has a leader. The leader can set a time to start the adventure for treasure island. Anyone who wants to join the adventure should send his/her units to the guild before that time. The chief also set the minimum and the maximum number of each unit needed to start the adventure.&#x20;

The adventure will starts immediately if the maximum number of required units joined the battle. The leader should set the formation of units before starting the adventure.

if the required minimum units, do not get filled by guild members on time which the guild leader has set, the adventure will be canceled.

### Adventure Reward Share

Every player who joined the adventure will get a share based on how much damage and healing his/her units delivered and received in the battle(s).

Player Score = total damage dealt + total damage received + total healing delivered

Player Reward Share = (Player Score / Players Total Score) \* Total Reward
