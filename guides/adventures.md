### Dungeons

You can send your troops to find a dungeon and fight monsters and defeat them to get treasuries in dungeons. It may take a few days for your troops to find a dungeon. There is a chance for you to find rare items for your troops or capture dragons or goblins in dungeons to use them in your army in future adventures.

### Treasure Island

You can set your army to explore and find treasures. It may take 1 to 10 Days to find a treasure island. There may be monsters on the island that you have to defeat to capture the island. Collecting speed depends on the sum of the attack power of your heroes it's 1 CLEG per 2 attack power per day. And also you have to be ready to defend yourself from the ambush of other players to capture your island. You can create walls to make a defense advantage.

If you see someone already is in the island, you can attack him/her to capture the island. You can Scout the island by paying some gold to get valuable info about enemy units and defensive structures. Or you can dismiss this island and continue exploring new Islands.
