# ‚õè Buildings

Resource buildings help you to gather CLEG tokens, Stone, and Iron to make your progress in the game. Resource buildings have Health. They lose 2 HP per day and will stop working when their HP reaches 0. You can repair them by paying the game's token. Buildings Lose 5% of their performance by losing every 20 HP. The repair cost to recover 100 HP is 50% of the building value (the cost to build and upgrade the building to reach the current level).

Resource buildings also have a capacity. You have to collect their resources before they get full and stop working.

### Upgrades

Upgrades take time depending on the building level. You can pay 10% more resources to have 24 hours deducted from the remaining upgrade timer. For example, for a building that needs 1000 tokens and 3 days to get upgraded, you can pay 1300 tokens to upgrade your building instantly.
