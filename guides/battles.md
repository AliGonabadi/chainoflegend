## Dungeons

Every 24 hours a dungeon is available for you to go on an adventure you have to fight monsters and defeat them to get treasuries in dungeons.

## Treasure Island

You can set your army to explore and find treasures. It may take 1 to 10 Days to find a treasure island. If You are lucky, the island is empty and you can start collecting treasures. Collecting speed depends on the sum of the attack power of your heroes it's 1 gold per 100 attack damage per day. And also you have to be ready to defend yourself from the ambush of other players to capture your island. You can create walls to make a defense advantage.

If you see someone already is in the island, you can attack him/her to capture the island. You can Scout the island by paying some gold to get valuable info about enemy units and defensive structures. Or you can dismiss this island and continue exploring new Islands.
