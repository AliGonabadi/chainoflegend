Units lose HP in battles and it takes time (depending on [Barracks ](broken-reference)level) to recover their HP.

## Damage and Resistance

Armor and Magic Resistance help units to receive less damage.

Here is how Armor affects Physical Damage:

Physic Resistance = 1 - ( 1 / ( Armor / 100 + 1))

Example: A unit with 50 Armor will receive **33%** less physycal Damage:

Physic Resistance = 1 - ( 1 / ( 50 / 100 + 1)) =  **33%**

Magic Resistance has same formula:

Magic Resistance = 1 - ( 1 / ( Magic Resistance / 100 + 1))
