# âš” Battles

On the [adventure](adventures.md) page, you can send your [troops ](heroes.md)to [dungeons ](adventures.md#dungeons)and[ treasure islands](adventures.md#treasure-island) which leads them to a battle at last. Battles are automated turn-based. user can set strategy and the formation of troops before a battle. and watch the battle replay. Also, the user can set the target priority of units in this case unit will attack to highest priority target in its range.&#x20;

Priorities:

* Closest
* Highest HP
* Lowest HP
* Highest Damage

Units lose HP in battles and it takes time (depending on [Barracks ](broken-reference)level) to recover their HP.

## Damage and Resistance

Armor and Magic Resistance help units to receive less damage in battles.

Here is how Armor affects Physical Damage:

Physic Resistance = 1 - ( 1 / ( Armor / 100 + 1))

Example: A unit with 50 Armor will receive **33%** less physycal Damage:

Physic Resistance = 1 - ( 1 / ( 50 / 100 + 1)) =  **33%**

Magic Resistance has same formula:

Magic Resistance = 1 - ( 1 / ( Magic Resistance / 100 + 1))
