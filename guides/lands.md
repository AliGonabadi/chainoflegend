# Lands

You need lands to deploy your buildings and start earning resources. each land has a limited amount of resources. When resources of a land got finished, you have to find a new one. Lands are limited to the reward pool. They will be distributed to the users over time. To control inflation, When more users extract land resources, the reward pool’s tokens will get decreased, hence land distribution will get slower. This will help users’ assets to remain always valuable.&#x20;

As long as users spend their tokens in the game, tokens will directly get transferred into the reward pool and new lands will get regenerated.

There are 5 type5 of lands:

1. **Desert**: Has \~25 tokens\*\* and no Iron and stone resources. every new user can start with this land with -10% earning rate (2800 lands available per day)
2. **Common**: Has \~235 tokens\*\*, Iron, and Stone. (1400 lands available per day)
3. **Uncommon:** Has \~700 tokens\*\*, Iron, and Stone. +10% earning rate. (480 lands available per day)
4. **Rare:** Has \~2800 tokens\*\*, Iron, and Stone. +20% earning rate. (100 lands available per day)
5. **Legendary:** Has \~14000 tokens\*\*, Iron, and Stone. +30% earning rate. (20 lands available per day)

\*\* after each [mining cycle](../tokenomics/price-stability.md#mining-cycles), resources of new lands will be deducted by 5%. read more about mining cycles
