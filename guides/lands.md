# üèù Lands

You need lands to deploy your [buildings ](buildings.md)and start earning resources. each land has a limited amount of resources. When resources of a land got finished, the land will be dismissed, and you have to find a new one. Lands are limited to the reward pool. They will be distributed to the users over time. To control inflation, When more users extract land resources, the reward pool‚Äôs tokens will get decreased, hence land distribution will get slower. This will help users‚Äô assets to remain always valuable.&#x20;

There is 5 type of lands:

![Desert: Has \~25 tokens\* and no Iron and stone resources. every new user can start with this land with -10% earning rate (2800 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-desert.png) ![Common: Has \~235 tokens\*, Iron, and Stone. (1400 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-common.png)

![Uncommon: Has \~700 tokens\*, Iron, and Stone. +10% earning rate. (480 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-uncommon.png) ![Rare: Has \~2800 tokens\*, Iron, and Stone. +20% earning rate. (100 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-rare.png)

![Legendary: Has \~14000 tokens\*, Iron, and Stone. +30% earning rate. (20 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-legendary.PNG)

{% hint style="warning" %}
&#x20;\* after each [mining cycle](../price-stability.md#mining-cycles), resources of new lands will be deducted by 5%. read more about [mining cycles](../price-stability.md#mining-cycles)
