# Lands

You need lands to deploy your buildings and start earning resources. each land has a limited amount of resources. When resources of a land finishes, you have to find a new one. Lands are limited to the reward pool. They will be distributed to the users over time. To control inflation, When more users extract land resources, the reward pool’s tokens will get decreased, hence land distribution will get slower. This will help users’ assets to remain always valuable.

As long as users spend their tokens in the game, tokens will directly get transferred into the reward pool and new lands will get regenerated.

There are 5 type5 of lands:

1. **Desert**: Has 1000 Gold and no Iron and stone resources. every new user starts with this land with -10% lower earning rate (Unlimited land)
