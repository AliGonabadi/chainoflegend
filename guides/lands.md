# üèù Lands

You need lands to place your [buildings ](buildings.md)and start earning resources. Each land has limited amounts of resources. When the resources of a land finish, the land will disappear, and you have to find a new one. Lands are limited to the reward pool. They will be distributed to the users over time. To control inflation, the reward pool‚Äôs tokens will get decreased when more users extract land resources, hence land distribution will get slower. This will help users‚Äô assets to always remain valuable.&#x20;

There are 5 types of lands:

![Desert: Has \~25 tokens\* and no Iron and Stone resources. Every new user can start with this land with -25% earning rate (2800 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-desert.png) ![Common: Has \~235 tokens\*, Iron and Stone. (1400 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-common.png)

![Uncommon: Has \~700 tokens\*, Iron and Stone. +10% earning rate. (480 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-uncommon.png) ![Rare: Has \~2800 tokens\*, Iron and Stone. +20% earning rate. (100 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-rare.png)

![Legendary: Has \~14000 tokens\*, Iron and Stone. +30% earning rate. (20 lands available per day)](../.gitbook/assets/land-legendary.PNG)

&#x20;\* After each [mining cycle](../price-stability.md#mining-cycles), resources of new lands will be deducted by 5%. read more about [mining cycles](../price-stability.md#mining-cycles)
